# Kaggle Learning Repository

This is a repository where I store my code and data for learning from Kaggle competitions. I use the following folder structure to organize my files:

kaggle
├── data
│   ├── raw # Store the original datasets
│   ├── processed # Store the processed datasets
│   └── submissions # Store the prediction files
├── code
│   ├── notebooks # Store the jupyter notebooks
│   ├── scripts # Store the python scripts
│   └── utils # Store the helper functions and modules
├── models # Store the trained models
└── README.md # Explain the purpose, methods and results of the project

I use different notebooks for different tasks, such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and prediction. I also use some scripts and utils to run some common operations. I download the data from Kaggle website using Kaggle CLI or API, and upload my prediction files to get scores. I try different models and techniques to improve my performance on the leaderboard.

This repository is for educational purposes only. I do not claim any ownership of the data or the code. All credits go to Kaggle and the original authors of the competitions.
